/// Initialized for the object using the specified parameters.
/**
 Initializes a base selfie capture experience and binds it to the given image capture control.  The experience class overrides the capture control delegate to provide additional behavior and guidance useful for capturing documents.  It also forwards delegate invocations to the original delegate set on the capture control, thus acting as a proxy.
 
 If you are interested in handling any of the delegate methods on the capture control, it is important that you set your delegate before initializing the capture experience.  Setting a new delegate after initializing the capture experience will break the association with the capture control, and allow the capture experience to be shut down and deallocated if no other references to the object remain.  This is the proper protocol for cleaning up a capture experience you are no longer interested in.
 
 The selfie capture experience will add several overlays and subviews on top of the associated image capture control for visual guidance and feedback.  It will also manage some of the capture control's native properties, which could interfere with any properties you directly modify on the control.
 
 @param captureControl An instance of a kfxKUIImageCaptureControl object and cameraType set to kfxKUIFrontCamera to avoid unkonwn results.
 @param criteria A collection of constraints and attributes that control the behavior of the capture experience. Pass nil for the default experience.

 Icon is placed inside of the balloon and its position and size depends on the balloon size and text message.
 Icon will be centered inside balloon if there is no text message, otherwise it will be horizontally centered and shifted to the top to hold from 33% to 50% of vertical space depending on message length. Icon is scaled to fit available balloon space with fixed aspect ratio.
