/**
 Given a center point and aspect ratio, a ellipse frame will be constructed to cover as much of the image as possible without any the distances between a frame edge and image edge falling below the padding distance, calculated as percent of the perpendicular image edge length.  Values will be clamped to the range [1-50].  The default value is 10.
 
 For example:
 - Given detection settings with a frame center at the center of the image, and a personal check aspect ratio, the constructed frame will fill the width of the image, leaving a space on the left and right equal to the padding percent of the image width.
 
 - Given detection settings with a frame center shifted to the left of the image center, the gap on the right side of the constructed frame will exceed the gap on the left.
